This project was inspired and guided by Beau Carnes's tutorial [introducing the MERN stack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CqJlxBYj-M).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Running the Project Locally

### Start the Server! 
Within the project directory, navigate to the backend directory

#### `cd backend`
(path = /anch-inventory/backend)

#### Run `npm install`

To start up the server:
#### `nodemon server.js`

The console should eventually print: 
`Server is running on port: 5000`
`Database connection established`

### Check out the front end! 

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm install`
#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
